This R package is used to calculate the proprtions of the two numeric vectors.

```{r}
library("Lab5")
```

This package consists of a data set containing the raw vote totals for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for each of Iowa's 99 counties from 2016 elections. By using the `proportion` function in `Lab5` package we calculated the functions by row (by default).
```{r}
data("Iowa")
head(Iowa)
prop<-proportion(Iowa[,2],Iowa[,3])
head(prop)
```

The proportions can also be calculated by row by giving arugument `byRow = TRUE`. 
```{r}
prop<-proportion(Iowa[,2],Iowa[,3],byrow = FALSE)
print(prop)
```
